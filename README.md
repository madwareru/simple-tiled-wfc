# simple-tiled-wfc

A Rust library which allows a user to generate tiled levels 
with a simple implementation of Wave Function Collapse algorithm.

For an example usage you may look at [ply-generator](https://github.com/madwareru/ply-generator)

Or, if you are happened to have a legal GOG copy of Rage Of Mages game (also known as Аллоды: Печать тайны), you can 
also examine a more complex example [here](https://github.com/madwareru/orom-second-encounter/tree/master/examples/generate_map)
